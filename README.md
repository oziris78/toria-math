# Telek Math
A lightweight Java math library with additional utility classes.

## Importing Telek Math
Add these to your build.gradle file

```GROOVY
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.oziris78:telek-math:v0.6'
}
```


## How To Use Telek Math

Telek Math currently has no wiki, but it has javadocs to guide you!

Most methods don't actually have javadocs because they're 
pretty simple to understand and use, their parameter names 
and method signatures should be enough for anyone.

When it comes to methods that don't have explanatory names, 
Telek Math has detailed javadocs. Just hover over the method's 
signature (name) on your IDE and you'll see the information.
Also you can just click on the signature while holding down 
CTRL to see how it works.

### Some Notes
- I am not thinking about creating a wiki soon...
- Telek Math was written by only one person (Oğuzhan Topaloğlu)
- Telek Math is currently (version 0.4) not optimized at all, 
  code still runs fast but it lacks a lot of optimizations...
- Most classes aren't that well written and they lack many functions.
